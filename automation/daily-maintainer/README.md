# VISTA World Daily Maintainer Safety Core

This package implements the deterministic trust boundary used before a daily
maintenance patch can be published. It does not schedule runs, invoke a model,
write to GitHub, or manage production runtime.

The core provides:

- a digest-bound, strict YAML contract for human-reviewed candidate backlogs;
- code-owned validation profile IDs with fixed cwd and argv;
- deterministic candidate selection;
- a Git diff guard for path, symlink, binary, secret, size, and test-weakening
  policy;
- a credential-free verifier that never enables a subprocess shell; and
- canonical receipt serialization, SHA-256 binding, and journal markers.

From the repository root, run the complete test suite with:

    uv run --project automation/daily-maintainer python -m unittest discover \
      -s automation/daily-maintainer/tests -p 'test_*.py'

For package-local development:

    cd automation/daily-maintainer
    uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -p 'test_*.py'

Both discovery forms are intentionally supported.
